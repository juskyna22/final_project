Task 4: Package the application

In this task, you will package the application created in the previous steps.

1.  Perform the relevant steps in creation of the package. Set the name of the package to EmotionDetection.

2  Once completed, take a screenshot of the contents of the init file along with the final folder structure of the final_project directory.

   Make sure to fit both of the images into a single screenshot and name it 4a_packaging.png.

3.  To make sure that the EmotionDetection is a valid package, you need to test the package. To do this:
    Run a python shell in the terminal.

    Import the emotion_detector function from the package.

    If the package is created accurately, you will not receive any error messages.

    Test run the function again with the statement I hate working long hours.
    Verify that the output displays the dominant emotion as anger.
4. Take a screenshot of this terminal output and save it as 4b_packaging_test.png.
