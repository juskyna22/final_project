Task 5: Run unit tests on your application

With a functional application being available, you now need to run unit tests to validate the application output.

1. To run unit tests, create a new file, test_emotion_detection.py that calls the required application function from the package and tests it for the following statements and dominant emotions.

Statement	Dominant Emotion
I am glad this happened	joy
I am really mad about this	anger
I feel disgusted just hearing about this	disgust
I am so sad about this	sadness
I am really afraid that this will happen	fear

2. Once complete, take a screenshot of the code and save it as 5a_unit_testing.png.

3. Execute the test_emotion_detection.py file on terminal.

4. Check the unit test output to verify that the unit tests have passed.

5. Take a screenshot of the terminal output of this execution and save it as 5b_unit_testing_result.png.
