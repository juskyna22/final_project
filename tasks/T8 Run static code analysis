Task 8: Run static code analysis

Finally, its time to check code compliance.

1. Run static code analysis on the code you created. Use PyLint library on server.py file and try to generate a 10/10 score. You will have to modify the server.py file to get this score. Take a snapshot of the modified file and name it as 8a_server_modified.png.

Note: The difference between a 9/10 score and a 10/10 score may be use of Docstrings. Include Docstrings in all functions of your codes.

2. Take a screenshot of a 10/10 output on the terminal after running static code analysis. Name the screenshot as 8b_static_code_analysis.png.
